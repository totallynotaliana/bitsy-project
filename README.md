# Escape the RAPTOR
This game will be a recreation of the Raptors in the kitchen scene from Jurassic Park (1993) where the Raptors are hunting the two kids named Lex and Tim. They are trying to escape the Raptors and create various distractions in order to get away and escape sucessfully

## Vision (so far)
My current ideas for how to adapt the Jurassic Park scene into Bitsy are:
- Recreating the Kitchen for the background
- Having Tim and Lex starting at the bottom of the screen, while the Raptors will stay near the top/the exit
- You wil play as Lex since she's doing the most movment in the scene
- The second "room" that will be used is when Lex hides in the vent/oven thing and I'll create a small space for the room
- Having objects that you can pick up that'll trigger dialogue to play

## Potential outline
1. Talk to Tim to trigger dialogue
2. Pick up the blob next to you to trigger more dialogue
3. You can keep talking to Tim if you wish
4. Move through the ailes in the kitchen
5. Touch collectible bubbles that trigger the Raptor noises
6. Go into the vent/oven thing and pick up another collectable bubble that triggers dialogue
7. Leave the Vent
8. The Raptors will have changed position, with Tim by the Freezer door and the Raptor in the Freezer
9. Go to the Freezer and help Tim to lock the Raptor in
10. Go to the exit where the Raptors first came from to escape and end game
